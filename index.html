			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/diamanda-galas.jpg" alt="Diamanda Galas">
				<p>Galás has been described as “capable of the most unnerving vocal terror”, with her three and a half octave vocal range. Her works largely concentrate on the topics of AIDS, mental illness, despair, injustice, condemnation, and loss of dignity. She has worked with many avant-garde composers.</p>

			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/anita-oday-2.jpg" alt="Anita O'Day">
				<p>O’Day was admired for her rhythm and dynamics, and for shattering the traditional image of the “girl singer”. Refusing to pander to any gender stereotype, O’Day presented herself as a “hip” jazz musician, in a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown.</p>

				<p>Also known as the “First Lady of Song”, “Queen of Jazz”, and “Lady Ella”, Fitzgerald had a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6), and was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a “horn-like” improvisational ability.</p>

			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/sonny-sharrock.jpg" alt="Sonny Sharrock">
				<p>One of few guitarists in the first wave of free jazz in the 1960s, Sharrock was known for his incisive, heavily chorded attack, his highly-amplified bursts of wild feedback, and for his use of saxophone-like lines played loudly on guitar.</p>

			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/duke-ellington.jpg" alt="Duke Ellington">
				<p>In the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of The Boston Globe, “[i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.” Duke Ellington called his music “American Music” rather than jazz.</p>

			<h2>Miles Davis</h2>

			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/miles-davis.jpg" alt="Miles Davis">
				<p>“So What” has only two chords: D-7 and E&#9837;-7. Davis said that the inspiration for the album came from a lamellophone player he heard in a Ballet Africaine performance, and a childhood memory of walking down a dark country road in Arkansas, hearing gospel music.</p>

			<h2>Charlie Parker</h2>
			<p class="date">Posted on July 14, 2017</p>
			
			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/charlie-parker.jpg" alt="Charlie Parker">
				<p>Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas, including rapidly passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. He remains probably the most influential saxophone player of all time.</p>

			<p class="date">Posted on July 14, 2017</p>
			
			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/thelonious-monk.jpg" alt="Thelonious Mark">
				<p>His compositions are full of dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists, and are consistent with Monk’s unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of silences and hesitations.</p>

			<div class="article-main">
				<img src="images/dizzy-gillespie.jpg" alt="Dizzy Gillespie">
				<p>Gillespie was such a complex player that contemporaries ended up copying Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead; it was not until Jon Faddis’s emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy’s style was successfully recreated. He was described as the “Sound of Surprise”.</p>

				<img src="images/john-zorn.jpg" alt="John Zorn">
				<p>“People are so obsessed with the surface that they can’t see the connections, but they are there. When I sit down and make music, a lot of things come together. Sometimes it falls a little bit towards the jazz, sometimes it falls toward rock, sometimes it doesn’t fall anywhere, it’s just floating in limbo.</p>
